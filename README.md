# Kubernetes Helm Charts

> Inspired by [helm-charts | USA-RedDragon](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/helm-charts)

The code is provided as is without warrenties to others or myself.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add demeesterdev https://charts.demeester.dev
```

You can then run `helm search repo demeesterdev` to see the charts.
